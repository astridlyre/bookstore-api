# Bookstore API

This is a project to showcase my abilities to create a backend API. The concept is a
simple bookstore, with the requirements to track book sales, employees, clients, among
other things.

This project uses:

- Express.js
- PostgreSQL and Sequelize
- Redis for caching
- Ajv for JSON schema validation

Eventually, I will have more documentation and integrate this with Swagger-UI to generate
the docs automatically.
